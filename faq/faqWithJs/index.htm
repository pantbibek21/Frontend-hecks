            <div class="answer">
                <p>I recommend that you take this course if you already know the basics of HTML and CSS.
                    Prior JavaScript knowledge is helpful but not mandatory.
                </p>
                <p>Already know Sass/SCSS and responsive design? Awesome!. You still may benefit
                    from this course because I'll show you how to build things in multiple ways
                    using flexbox and CSS grid.

            <div class="question">Who is this course NOT for? <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i></div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>If you're complete beginner to HTML and CSS, this course may go a little over your head.</p>
                <p>Also, if you're looking for a JavaScript-heavy course, you will be disappointed. We'll be using
                    JavaScript to build
                    sections like hamburger menu, but this course is more focused on writing responsive styles with
                    SCSS.

            <div class="question">Will this course be paid? <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i></div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Yes. While I would love to be able to help everyone for free, it simply wouldn't be sustainable for
                    me.</p>
                <p>So yes, this course will be a paid course. But! I am planning on supporting Purchasing Power Parity
                    and other ways to make
                    my course more accessible to everyone.

            <div class="question">Will there be online community for students? <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Yes! If you purchase the course, you'll get access to an exclusive Discord community. It will be a
                    place where you can ask questions
                    and get help from me and other people in the community ðŸ™‚.

            <div class="question">What will the course give me that your YouTube videos don't? <i
                    class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i></div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Honestly, a lot. I do make very in-depth coding tutorials on YouTube, but they're more of a "live
                    coding" style where I'll
                    explain things as they come up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This course, on the other hand, is getting completely written and planned out before
                    recording any video tutorials. I'll also be covering topics like introduction to npm, Gulp, Sass,
                    and responsive
                    design principles.
