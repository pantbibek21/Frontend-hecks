        <details>
            <summary>Who is this course for?</summary>
            <p>I recommend that you take this course if you already know the basics of HTML and CSS.
                Prior JavaScript knowledge is helpful but not mandatory.
            </p>
            <p>Already know Sass/SCSS and responsive design? Awesome!. You still may benefit
                from this course because I'll show you how to build things in multiple ways
                using flexbox and CSS grid.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Who is this course NOT for?</summary>
            <p>If you're complete beginner to HTML and CSS, this course may go a little over your head.</p>
            <p>Also, if  you're looking for a JavaScript-heavy course, you will be disappointed. We'll be using JavaScript to build
                sections like hamburger menu, but this course is more focused on writing responsive styles with SCSS.
            </p>

        <details>
            <summary>Will this course be paid?</summary>
            <p>Yes. While I would love to be able to help everyone for free, it simply wouldn't be sustainable for me.</p>
            <p>So yes, this course will be a paid course. But! I am planning on supporting Purchasing Power Parity and other ways to make 
                my course more accessible to everyone.
            </p>

        <details>
            <summary>Will there be online community for students?</summary>
            <p>Yes! If you purchase the course, you'll get access to an exclusive Discord community. It will be a place where you can ask questions
                and get help from me and other people in the community ðŸ™‚.
            </p>

        <details>
            <summary>What will the course give me that your YouTube videos don't?</summary>
            <p>Honestly, a lot. I do make very in-depth coding tutorials on YouTube, but they're more of a "live coding" style where I'll 
                explain things as they come up.
            </p>
            <p>
                This course, on the other hand, is getting completely written and planned out before
                recording any video tutorials. I'll also be covering topics like introduction to npm, Gulp, Sass, and responsive
                design principles.
